# ROMBot-IQ

The program is a web application written in C# that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate answers to user questions. The program first loads a set of pre-trained word embeddings from a CSV file and stores them in a dictionary. When a user submits a question to the web application, the program uses the OpenAI API to generate an embedding for the question, then compares this embedding to the pre-trained embeddings to find the closest match. If no match is found, the program uses the OpenAI API to generate an answer and stores the question-answer pair in a list for future training.

The program also includes a training mode, where it trains a text classification model using TensorFlow on the list of question-answer pairs. This model can then be used to improve the accuracy of the program's answer generation over time. The program is deployed as an Azure web app and includes a simple HTML interface for users to enter their questions.

## Further ideas to develop the program:

**Improve the chatbot's response**: The current implementation simply selects the closest embedding to the input question, but you could explore more sophisticated approaches like natural language processing, machine learning models, or integrating other APIs like Dialogflow or Wit.ai to generate more accurate and natural responses.

**Implement authentication**: The web app currently does not require any authentication, which could be a potential security risk. You could implement authentication using OAuth or other authentication protocols to ensure that only authorized users can access the app.

**Integrate with other services**: You could integrate the web app with other services like a database, a messaging service, or a notification service to provide more functionality and improve the user experience.

**Improve the training process**: The current implementation trains the model using a simple binary classification approach, but you could explore other training methods like transfer learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the training process.

**Expand the scope**: The current implementation only answers questions related to a specific domain, but you could expand the scope of the program to cover multiple domains and provide more comprehensive answers to a wider range of questions.
